    "This project encompasses a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis by leveraging the Yelp API, web scraping techniques, data preprocessing, and machine learning modeling. Here's a detailed breakdown of each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connecting to the Yelp API: The initial stage involves connecting to the Yelp API to retrieve business information. This connection is crucial for accessing structured data about various businesses, such as their names, locations, and URLs to their Yelp review pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Web Scraping Reviews: Once we have the URLs from the Yelp API, the next step is to perform web scraping. This process involves making HTTP requests to each URL and parsing the HTML content to extract review text and ratings. We use BeautifulSoup, a Python library, to navigate through the HTML structure of the Yelp review pages and systematically extract the relevant data, typically limiting ourselves to a certain number of reviews per business due to display constraints on the web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Balancing the Rating Data: An inherent challenge in sentiment analysis is dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one sentiment class (e.g., positive) might be overrepresented compared to another (e.g., negative). To address this, we use the \"imblearn\" library to either oversample the minority class or undersample the majority class. For this project, we chose oversampling, which enhances the dataset by replicating instances of the underrepresented class, thus providing a more balanced and richer dataset for training our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sentiment Assignment: We then assign a sentiment label to each review. This is done by converting the numerical ratings into categorical sentiment labelsâ€”reviews with ratings of 4 or higher are labeled as 'positive', while those with ratings of 3 or lower are labeled as 'negative'. This binary classification aligns with typical sentiment analysis objectives, simplifying the model's task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Building a Classification Model: The core of this project is the development of a machine learning model for sentiment classification. We employ a decision tree classifier, a fundamental yet powerful algorithm in machine learning. Decision trees are particularly suited for this task due to their ability to handle varied feature types and their interpretability. They work by learning decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Text Analysis Processes: Alongside the numerical analysis of ratings, we also perform text analysis on the review content. This involves extracting features from the text data, such as word frequencies or presence of specific keywords or phrases, which are then fed into the decision tree classifier. The combination of text analysis with the sentiment labels allows the model to learn how different textual patterns correlate with positive or negative sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Model Evaluation and Refinement: Once the model is built, we evaluate its performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. Based on these evaluations, we refine the model through techniques like hyperparameter tuning or feature selection to enhance its predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Final Output: The end goal of this project is to create a robust model capable of accurately classifying Yelp reviews into positive or negative sentiments. This model can be utilized for various purposes, such as understanding customer satisfaction, gauging public opinion on certain services or establishments, or even guiding business strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step in this project contributes to the overarching goal of developing a reliable sentiment analysis tool using data from Yelp, showcasing the interplay between API data retrieval, web scraping, data preprocessing, and machine learning."

      "Review Text: We felt like Thai for dinner and decided to visit this neighborhood joint, and we're far from disappointed! The place had an amazing Thai vibe, two floors and a patio that was jam packed with patrons. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but there were so many places just outside to look at.We started with the coconut soup, with chicken. The aroma with such a milk infusion of lemon grass, citrus and coconut hits your face as the waiter places in front of you, and I have to admit that's when I started heavily salivating. The soup was loaded with fresh chicken slices, and topped with coriander, great combination, and a little on the spicy side, just how we like it.I had the Thai ice tea, and it really does taste like what they make in Thailand, there was a delicate balance of herbs, a robust tea taste, and the sweet creaminess of the condensed milk, wow, perfection! I would highly recommend this if your into Thai ice tea. In fact I would probably go back just to have this with their mango sticky rice (which I've had at a previous dinner here).Our appetizer came, warm, crispy, and loaded with filling. The tofu roll had a good amount of shrimp, and other items, this was also spicy, but it came with a sweet cause to dip into, which was a good complimentary flavour for the rolls and balanced the spice in them.The last item we ordered was the pineapple chicken curry, which I think was ok. I know this is one of those dishes that people rave about, but I honestly didn't understand the hype here. Thought I've been here several Times previously, and thoroughly enjoyed my meals, this is the one time I wished I had ordered something else. The pineapple chunks were not sweet, they were kind of salty, and the curry wasn't very balanced in their spice profile. I was quite surprised, as this restaurant has always previously been 100% impressive for all of our dishes. However, the coconut rice was exactly as I remember, super fresh, and absolutely delicious!The service from start to finish was great, staff were knowledgeable, and when you asked for opinions of food choices, they didn't recommend the most expensive menu item, but did just speak to us about the entire list of appetizers (I wish they narrowed it down for us though).We can't wait to be back!\n",

      "Review Text: Koh Lipe is on the Michelin Guide, which peaked my interest in trying this restaurant. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table since we didn't get a chance to make a reservation, which was a mistake. Make sure to have a reservation if you plan on dining here. This place was packed, probably because of how good the food is!The restaurant looks quite eccentric, with lots of colours and tropical decor. Makes you feel like you are eating in Thailand! It is on the smaller side, however, so you'll be very close to your neighbouring tables. We ended up sitting on the outside patio since there was no space inside.We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and the Khao Pad (Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken). The Chicken Pad Thai was probably the best Pad Thai that I've had for sure. It was super flavourful, and the side of peanuts is such a great addition to a Pad Thai. The only thing was that there was a too many bean sprouts (I usually prefer more noodles over bean sprouts). The coconut sticky rice that comes with the fried rice was SO GOOD. The chicken was super spicy (probably should have ordered mild), but the coconut rice does a good job of cooling your mouth down.\n",

The Khao soi was quite a large portion with delicious flat egg noodles, tender braised beef and a chunk of fried deliciousness. I ordered a medium spice but I couldn't taste it very much.

I had been dying to come here for a really long time now. When we arrived they had a table ready for us. There were so many good things on the menu that it was difficult to pick. And the end we were very happy with all of our choices. The cowboy was absolutely phenomenal, and the fried rice tasted delicious. The drink was also super refreshing. The ambiance here is casual and party like, as if on vacation in Thailand. I'm really glad we came here!\n",

The decor is clean and has a vibe of street food places in Asia.Speaking of the food, I had the mussels with curry, and we shared the barbecue chicken and the deep-fried chicken. I love the barbecue chicken; it has a little taste of sweetness, making it a great appetizer. One thing that took off a star for me was that the beans in our fried rice were slightly undercooked. Besides that, Koh Lipe is a great place to check out Thai food. Reasonable pricing and portions are super fulfilling.\n",

      "Review Text: I read an article about how great this restaurant is, so I bookmarked it for a future visit. A few years forward and my friend said she was craving Thai food. So I made a reservation for Saturday dinner.The restaurant was small and fun! There were decorations all around. My boyfriend and I arrived before my friend did, so we checked-in at our reservation time and requested to be seated at the patio. The staff were friendly and helpful- they suggested a few popular items off the menu and kindly reminded us about the time limit for dining.While waiting, we ordered two drinks, Jas-mi-peach and Thai green tea. Both drinks were lightly sweet and refreshing! When my friend arrived, we ordered our mains: My boyfriend ordered Tom Yum with chicken and two Mii Pu (for takeout). My friend ordered Khao Soi with braised beef and I ordered the same one with veggies and tofu.The portion size was very generous- it could be shared between two people! Khao Soi was delicious, the noodles were lightly chewy, the broth was a bit spicy, the veggies and tofu pieces were well-cooked. My friend and boyfriend said they also enjoyed their meal. Due to the time limit to dine, we weren't able to enjoy eating and talking as much. Despite that, we had a good time.A few tips:- Make a reservation early! Time slots fill out fast.-There is a time limit for dining (90 minutes), so read the menu and decide beforehand- The seating (outside and inside) are very tight- bring the least amount of belongings.If you're looking for an adventure for your tastebuds, this is a great spot!\n",

We've both been meaning to try this spot and got seated on the patio.The space is a bit on the smaller side with tables quite close together. The inside of the restaurant is also beautifully decorated and a great vibe, especially in the summer.What we got:- Islamic noodles- Chicken pad thaiFinal Thoughts:The portion size was smaller than at other places I've been to, but the flavour was quite good. I think my expectations were quite high with all the hype this place has received so overall it was okay, but didn't blow me away.

Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation. From the appetizers to the dessert, every bite was a culinary delight. The chef's attention to detail and commitment to quality ingredients were evident in every dish.And the location! It's a charming spot that adds to the overall ambiance. We were lucky enough to dine on the outdoor patio, which offered a lovely view and a serene atmosphere. It's the perfect place to celebrate with friends and family, whether it's a special occasion or just a casual get-together.I can't recommend this restaurant enough.

All of the dishes were quite good; the pad gra pao had a little too much rice and not enough protein. The khao soi was the right amount of coconut-ty and curry.

The place has a very cozy vibe, with pretty dim lighting making it somewhat intimate for some good convo.Their menu, as with many other izakayas offers something for everyone. Ordered the takowasa ($9), tori karaage ($15), ebi mayo ($15) and mochi bacon ($7.5) along with the nama grapefruit ($12) and yuzu soda ($15) cocktails. Personal favorites were the ebi mayo and mochi bacon. The ebi mayo was actually very well done, large prawns with a bit of spice. Probably wouldn't get the karaage again since it just lacked flavour (even with the mayo). But everything else was pretty average. Jack of all trades kind of place.Strictly on food it'd be 3 stars but the cocktails I thought were really nice, light and easy to drink, making it a 4 star for me. They didn't really mix it when it got to the table but after a stir the flavors are great. Highly recommend both the cocktails!There's a handful of izakaya places in Toronto so it might be a while till Kintaro makes it back on my radar but solid place overall imo :)\",\n",

Very interesting and inventive vegetarian food, everything is so tasty. Don't miss out on the famous slaw. The goat cheese tart was also delicious, the vegetables are so deeply flavorful. The burrata tasted Italian (couldn't detect any Chinese influence) but really delicious, a flavorful pesto. The tofu was really good but probably not super unique, I've had similar tofu at other places. The only dish we didn't love was the vegetarian curry, we felt it was lacking flavor and difficult to eat since the paratha had wet things on it like a flatbread, so you could use it to properly scoop up the curry. But mainly the flavor was just kind of one note, not a ton of deep savory flavor. The decor in the new location wasn't right up my alley but definitely very unique and overall a nice vibe.I'm docking a star because they made us wait over 30min for our table and we had a reservation. There were a ton of people waiting and zero standing room so for 30+ min we were all basically pressed against each other and getting shoved as if we were at a club.

You mix it all up into a most delightfully goopy dish - so wet and moist, in fact, that you don't need the ramen anyway.It all filled me up to about 90%, so the side of gyoza that was included with the special got me  up to 100%.

It was listed as a hot sharable, and it is indeed sharable. You get large lettuce wraps, with a couple pieces of really well seasoned pork belly (that's not too overly fat) and some garnishes on the side.The Salmon Natto was also an interesting  cold sharable that I'd reorder next time as well! The server did warn us about the interesting and more acquired taste of Natto, but being quite adventurous with food, we went ahead and ordered it. It comes with natto on the side and the server mixes in the contents of the salmon, natto, egg, okra and onions in front of you. If you want a nice picture, make sure to take it beforehand becuase it becomes a slimy mess afterwards. If you're a textural person who doesnt like slimy foods - skip this. With the okra and natto combination, it does get quite slimy but the flavours are wonderful. You wrap the contents in seaweed that they provide and its quite a flavourful bite each time!The pumpkin croquette was very crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside.

This restaurant is now part of my list of favourites in Toronto.The restaurant offers a tasting menu of 5, 7, or 10 courses.  However considering we had a toddler we ordered off the a la carte menu instead.It is a rare restaurant where every single dish we ordered can be described as flawless.  But George somehow manages to achieve this!  While the dishes on offer may not be on the bleeding edge of Canadian cuisine, every dish allows you to truly appreciate what it SHOULD taste like.  From the flavours used to the combination of textures to the control of doneness, every single dish showed the true skills of the kitchen staff.  Every bite reminded me, \"they definitely know what they\\'re doing\".We ordered:Wagyu appetizer, tuna tartare, scallop, beef ribeye, halibut, gnocchi (off menu), cheese plate.All in all, if you\\'re looking for a solid meal of classic dishes done absolutely right, George is the place for you.  No gimmicks, no experimental/weird food trying to be \"creative\" to get arbitrary Michelin stars.  Just good food that makes you happy.',\n",

       " \"I visit Isshin Ramen at least ononcee every couple of months, it's a go-to place in my mind and the food is always great.Prices:with inflation, everything has gone up by $2-$3 dollars per item, and the add-ons are average $$1.50 extra, which easily makes your one bowl of ramen a $25 bill.Service:it's courteous, but my recent visit on Nov 23rd, 2024 with 4 other friends was disappointing. The staff wasn't rude, but the restaurant policy was illogical because when the staff asked how we want to split the bill, we mentioned we need separate bills - they then said they can't split the bill into 5 separate bills for our table and claimed that they can only split it into 2 bills. I don't understand, is it they don't want to, or they physically can't even if they wanted to?Either reason I find is illogical because if they claim that they can't create separate bills, then how do they create individual bills for all these other customers who are dining in the restaurant?  Looking around the whole restaurant, it's busy, filled with tables of 2, or 3, and/or solo dining, the solos are all sat along the SAME long table - so the fact that they can't split a bill for ONE (aka SAME) table of 5 is also saying they shouldn't be able to generate separate bills for the 5 different solo dining customers that are sitting along the same side table. Which, of course, we know, is not true because otherwise, they won't be able to bill anyone in the restaurant.So here's the lesson: DO NOT go to Isshin College location if you have a group of friends who believe in splitting the bill and want to have a nice casual meal and a good time. This restaurant is incapable of doing simple math as a service to their customers, meanwhile, they continue to set a default tip request to 15%.  Don't do extra work but still have the audacity to demand tip, just another greedy and lazy Toronto restaurant.I'm going to start going to MiSoya or Kinton more in the future because they know how to split the bills and understand that people who show up in groups will most likely want separate bills even though they are sitting at the same table.\",\n",

Very easy to drink as with most lagers and made for a nice contrast to the comparatively stronger ale. For food, I went with the bistro mac and cheese ($23) which overall was nice, but a bit small.

Either they were and our server intentionally didn't communicate that to us to save his table or it was only in our choice to leave that they reacted and found a solution.Further, the restaurants ability to sync between the food appearing at our table and the sommelier serving us our wine pairing was just poor.

Turns out, Nervosa lives up to the hype. But what I didn't know is that they're owned by the same group as Gusto 101 and Gusto 501, so some of the dishes are the same, and the food is fantastic.We started with the margherita pizza, and it was everything you want in a great pizza - the perfectly charred crust, nice chew on the dough, and the sauce hit just right with the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. After that we got their classic truffle mushroom pasta and rigatoni bolognese which were both delicious. They also had some great bottles of lambrusco (sparkling red wine) which helped craft the perfect summer vibe on their patio. Overall it was an excellent meal, and I can't wait to come back!\",\n",

Ordered the Traditional (19) which came with eggs, toast, bacon, homefries and salad. It was pretty average. I would prefer going to an actual diner over a place like this. Everything was just ok. They mention in the menu that the homefries are with their \"legendary sauce\", highkey just tastes like ketchup. Instead of a side of pancakes or waffles as with other diners its a pathetic piece of rye bread cut in half. Service was slow overall, took them a while to get us cutlery and water set up. They do have a student discount of 20% so make sure you show student ID if eligible, which makes the price a bit better.Just meh, and busy. Probably not coming back.',\n",

You can notice how deep the colouring and how little fat the salmon has. This means that it\\'s truly salmon and it\\'s not from a fish farm. Salmon from the fish farm should actually be called steelhead trout since it has never been to an ocean. It is also infested with parasites and sea lice and if you read the packaging when it is harvested, you are never supposed to serve it as sushi, but always cook it. You can read all about the salmon industry and Alexandra Morton\\'s excellent book. Just don\\'t think you\\'re eating anything healthy or environmentally sustainable when you\\'re eating \"salmon\" from a salmon farm. Personally, I never want to support this practice, so I always look for wild, organic, etc and ask where if comes from.The roll was very nice with real crab not kani, and you could taste the quality, even though it left us wanting more!The miso soup was perfect with just the right amount of seaweed in it. Again, it was literally three big sips and it was done so perhaps they could fill the tiny paper container full.Regardless, this Japanese restaurant is offering true quality, which is very hard to find on Uber eats -- only TonÃ© Sushi offers salmon of a similar quality, but it\\'s not in all the rolls but offered in one item.We need to support restaurants like this who are doing the right thing.',\n",

Great meal experience overall. This place gets high accolades (it also appears on the Michelin guide honourable mentions), and it did not disappoint.Food: 5/5========The food is most delicious. Each dish was well-thought-out. You can tell that they are serious about their food, as they have a big open gallery kitchen that is teaming with activity. Here's what we got:Smoked fish appetizer - $16. Most delicious spread. Very smokey. Was served with super thin potato chips. At first I thought it was weird to have a chip instead of a cracker, but it actually worked beautifully. Must try dish.Kampachi - $22 - delicious crudo. Must try.Celery root salad - $18 - very nice.Cauliflower - $18 - very nice.Skate - $35 - very delicious. Was very rich, like a braised beef.Five Spice Cake - $12. Yum! I LOVE five spice, and the cake did the spice mix justice.One complaint I had was that the cocktail list was basically non-existent. The one cocktail I tried (Bitter Spritz 18$) was not great (diluted, sweet and no bitters). The wine options were very expensive. I opted for the Saison beer (Burdock Tuesday $9), and I was not disappointed.Service: 4/5=========The service was mostly friendly, but a little lukewarm. The server knew the dishes very well, and was able to remember the options by heart. Very casual style of service overall (complete with hipster scruffy outfits), which is somewhat nice, and at the same time leaves you wanting a little more  warmth and elegance.Ambiance: 5/5============The ambiance overall is very nice. Let's start with the fact that the restaurant is located in hipster-central: Kensington Market. At the same time, it's definitely elevated for the neighbourhood. The place is very casual, but not without elegance. The decor is grungy, but not without style. The lights are nice and dim. It's definitely warm and rather romantic. You could definitely come here on a first date. The playlist was amazing. I kept wanting to Shazam the songs.Value: 3/5========The small plates are rather expensive. You won't leave here stuffed.

Miraculously, two other friends and I made it to the restaurant within the 15-minute timeframe, and upon arrival, the table was ready for us. The hostess had overestimated the wait time, showcasing a pleasant \"under promise, over deliver\" approach.We kicked off the celebration with some sharables, including the delightful CALAMARI FRITTI with chickpea flour and lemon aioli, and the flavourful DIAVOLA pizza with spicy sun-dried tomato pesto, smoked provolone, Calabrese salami, and roasted peppers. Each dish hit the spot and set the tone for the rest of the evening.For the main course, all the girls opted for the MAFALDE AI FUNGHI with portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, and truffle cream sauce, while I went with the tantalizing LINGUINE CON GAMBERI featuring basil and arugula, pine nuts, and wild shrimp. The dishes came out somewhat warm but were well-made and delicious.Drinks added to the celebratory vibe, with three of the girls ordering a custom sangria that wasn\\'t part of the regular menu, showcasing Gusto\\'s willingness to accommodate requests. Another friend and I enjoyed drinks from their menu, which were equally satisfying.Although Gusto 101 doesn\\'t offer complimentary birthday celebrations, they kindly added a candle to the TORTA DI FORMAGGIO (lemon mascarpone, ricotta, seasonal compote) that we selected to surprise our friend.The ambiance at Gusto 101 was vibrant but had its drawbacks. The location was fairly loud, making it challenging to hear each other, especially in the somewhat dark and dimly lit setting. The decor, though great, was in a tight space with small tables and chairs. The washroom, located in the basement area, had doors to the stalls that did not lock, requiring some improvisation.In conclusion, Gusto 101 delivered on flavour and atmosphere, making it a solid choice for a celebratory evening.

       " 'As I recount my latest experience at Alo, I grapple with the final mark: would I still consider them a 9 or a \"top pick\"? There were dishes that were incredible, but then some that missed the mark. The tasting menu ($225 per person) was off to a shaky start when the canapÃ©s arrived.We\\'re instructed to eat the four bites in a particular order. The first, an oyster with compressed cantaloupe and Iberico ham oil had a fishy essence without an acidic element (like the traditional mignonette or lemon) to help cut through the strong taste. It also seemed off that it wasn\\'t ice cold for something that should be served uber fresh. The first bite was a bust.Slowly, the redemption started with the beautifully presented uni tart, which was made even creamier with a thick crÃ¨me fraiche on the bottom. While this wasn\\'t mind-blowing, it was at least not repulsive.After the fishy oyster I had doubts about the mackerel tart, but this was unfounded as the meaty fish was very clean tasting and well balanced with bright pops of the daintiest tomatoes and fruit. Indeed, there was an ocean-like essence from the caviar, but it wasn\\'t overpowering.The canapÃ©s ended with a foie gras and strawberry jelly tart that created a sweet and savoury element. This was surprisingly good and wonderfully rich.It\\'s unclear if Alo is pandering to Michelin inspectors as the procession of Japanese dishes just seem out of place at a French restaurant. Sure, I can understand if they want to throw in one dish that\\'s has a Japanese influence, but to feature a handful was just too much.Moreover, some dishes just can\\'t live up to what you\\'d be served during an omakase meal. Chef Patrick Kriss should drop the madai course, a sea bream paired with chili oil, caviar, and kumquat. Like the oyster, it was fishy and warm. Give me this fish cool with freshly grated wasabi and soy sauce any day.The kinmedai was better, the red snapper was at least cold and refreshing with the oh so finely julienned radish in the centre. The various oils complimented the fish nicely and this was an improvement over the other sashimi course. If Alo must have a sashimi course (why would it), one is enough.Having a soft spot for chawanmushi I wouldn\\'t be opposed to this remaining on the menu. The actual steamed egg was hot and silky, but then enhanced with lovely French and Western elements: smooth foie gras tofu cubes, fragrant truffle paste, crunchy radish, sweet corn, and crispy chicken skin. All this amongst a pool of reduced capon broth. What an incredible dish!This is a long review, head to Gastro World for the rest.',\n",

I mean the tables are maroon-colored formica and it just WORKS (and makes me want it in my house lol) The 90s hip hop bumping on the speakers was the cherry on top.Now that I'm done waxing poetic about the space -- let's talk the important stuff: the food & drank!The cocktail menu is small but super creative. The bartenders also know wsup; I asked for a paper plane and they made a stellar paper plane.We had the:*Beef Tartare Crostini - fennel, egg yolk, jalapeÃ±o- great lil' bites! no complaints!*'Nduja Stuffed Olives - halloumi, sourdough, chimichurri - love the presentation on metal cocktail picks. Really nice savory bite and quite flavorful.*East Coast Oysters - tiger's milk mignonette - probably one of the best if not the best migonette I've had. Migonette is my preferred topping on oysters so I've had quite a few variations now and this one is killer!*Iceberg Wedge - avocado, chive cream, puffed wild rice - WOW, not your grandmother's iceberg wedge. I don't even usually like iceberg wedge, but this had such good flavor, textures..perfection. It was also huge - plenty to share with a dining companion.*Aloette Burger - beaufort cheese, onion, lettuce - the beaufort cheese on this was a thing of beauty. It was sliced thicc and square and pan fried (?) on both sides.*Fries - because a burger must have fries and these were damn good french fries! Handcut. Thicker. Freshly fried. delish. no notes.I wish we saved room for the impressive looking desserts, but we were stuffed!\",\n",

The food is delicious and it's really fun to order the flight of ciders. You can try something fruity, or sour, dry, or spicy if you're in the mood to be adventurous. The flight is fun because you get to compare them each side by side.What I love about this place is not only is the cider good, but the food is amazing as well.

       " 'If it weren\\'t for Summerlicious, I probably would\\'ve never visited this restaurant tucked away behind Downtown Camera - but I\\'m so glad that I ended up here! This is a Texas BBQ joint, a cuisine I haven\\'t really ever explored.To start, the interior is really classy and modern looking, and a lot bigger than it looks on the outside.Their Summerlicious menu consists of 3 courses. For the appetizer, I chose the caesar salad which came as two big chunks of lettuce that you cut up to make your salad. It sounds weird but I actually enjoyed it! The other options were salmon tartare and a mini birria quesadilla, which my friends both opted for - and they said both were good.For our main, we all chose the same thing: the pit platter, so the kitchen put all of our orders together on a huge platter (as the name suggests). There was enough for everyone to get two ribs, two slices of beef brisket, and more than a spoonful of pulled pork each. They had three \"hot\" sauces that I think are made in-house (?) but none of them were really that hot. As for the meat, the ribs were really tender and fell off the bone. They paired really well with the sweet \\'n spicy sauce offered. The brisket was my favourite; the flavour was so good and it paired well with the espresso hot sauce. And finally, I\\'m not a huge fan of pulled pork, but theirs wasn\\'t too bad.My dessert was the coconut creme pie and the coconut was super overpowering. I wish I had gotten the banoffie pie - it had a great texture and was much more pleasant to eat than the dry coconut.The service was quick and the manager/owner even stopped by at one point to give us a lil\\' history lesson on the building and the story of The Carbon Bar.Overall, this was a great visit - and for all the BBQ lovers out there, this is the spot for you!',\n",

There are two rows of patio seats outside which was a slight obstacle course to walk through. The umbrella base is this huge square block placed in the aisle so you have to walk over each one. We were seated and left alone with nothing. No menus or water for quite a bit of time. Finally, our server came and served us water. The menu was simple for lunch, several choices in handheld items but not many others besides mussels and one steak.Coworkers ordered tacos and they did not come with any sides so we also ordered the Belgian Frites. The tacos looked kind of small, the order came with four wonton sized pieces. The description on the menu for the Belgian Frites sounded amazing. \"Blanched in beef tallow & duck fat\" accompanied by two house made sauces. Unfortunately, the frites fell flat. The frites itself was not evenly fried, most of the pieces were soft. The sauces were bland and almost flavourless. I ordered the Steak Sandwich and it was okay. The striploin was done right, medium rare as requested. The bistro salad was overdressed, it was drenched in sauce.Overall, would not be back again. The food and service did not justify the price at all.',\n",

We decided to try it again for my birthday. The food here was so good.The four of us (including one toddler) ordered a few items to share from their a la carte menu. They also offered tasting menu options at this restaurant with 5, 7, 10 courses at different prices.We ordered a basket of bread (with a few varieties) for sharing before appetizers were served. It was gone so quickly. My boy ate so much. They also provided each of us a spoon of tasteful vegetable.Now the food we ordered:- Wagyu was sooooo yummy. Very soft and tender. Melted in my mouth immediately.- Tuna tartare: I could hardly figure out it was tuna tartare by just looking at the dish. The tuna was wrapped in a layer of crispy filling, which looked more like a crab cake. It was so perfectly flavoured. A dish full of creativity and surprise.- Scallop: topped with some leafy vegetable salad. Yummy as usual.- Gnocchi and halibut were good too, although not the best I've ever had.- Beef ribeye: impressive dish again. They have really good cut for the beef here.- Cow's Cheese platter with pears: I can never say no to cheese, especially when they were paired with refreshing pears.- Chocolate Basque cake: Good but not wowing.Overall, there was no dish that was not good here. The most impressive dishes were the beef, the tuna tartare and the wagyu. The service was okay too but not meeting Michelin standard yet. Maybe that's why they didn't get one star, but I'll give them one if I can! I can imagine this restaurant to be my top recommendation place for special event.\",\n",

Located in a converted mansion, it occupies 2 floors with multiple \\'rooms\\', leather couches, wide comfortable seats, wooden accent interior, and stained glass windows. We came around Christmas time, and the interiors were all decorated with very festive hoiday decorations and small Christmas trees.The first floor has a half open-concept kitchen that you can walk in and peek at what the chefs are doing. It also has spacious dining rooms with ample seatings (that tend to get filled up quickly as soon as it opens, so make a reservation where possibel!).We were seated upstairs by the window (with a lovely mini Christmas tree decoration right beside us), making a nice photo op. There was a bar with screens showing sports games in the middle of the floor, and rooms and dining tables around it. The bar has a different menu (e.g. you can order sliders at the bar). Washrooms are located on the 2nd floor.** FOOD **Food-wise, it\\'s excellent just like in any other The Keg location. Menu seems to be identical in most locations I\\'ve been to in Toronto. We tried their \"Holiday Features\" (special limited-time items) shareable sides, Caesar Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus with Spiced Hollandaise, and they were both super delectable - two of our favourite sides of the night (especially the Caesar Brussels Sprouts - crispy to perfection).For the mains, we ordered Lobster Tail Dinner and Mediterranean Cauliflower. The Lobster Tail Dinner came as 2 large lobster tails that easily slid off the shells. They were tender and perfect. It came with mushroom rice (just okay) and seasonal vegetables (steamed green beans and beets).The Mediterranean Cauliflower was my favourite main dish of the night. It consisted of oven-roasted cauliflower, green garbanzo bean hummus, couscous, pistachio nuts, and tahini lemon sauce. It was SO delicious! The Keg wins for a steakhouse serving the best vegetarian dishes on the menu. I\\'d definitely get this again the next time I visit The Keg.The sides of baked potato, fresh vegetables, mushroom rice, and sautÃ©ed mushrooms were all pretty good as well, but the holiday feature items / specials (Caesar Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus) were still the winners.** SERVICE **Great service - no complaints. Our server was attentive and brought things out exactly as asked. We were left to enjoy our meal without disturbance, and we were able to get their attention when needed. Nice overall dining experience with helpful staff all around.',\n",

I got the Mediterranean Pizza, which was fine and not very flavourful. I feel like I could have gotten something similar from Pi Co for less $. We also tried the Risotto Nervosa, which was small in size and quite unremarkable. I'm not a chef by any means, but I've cooked Mushroom Risotto that tasted similar. For dessert we got Tiramisu, which was pretty good. It was just sweet enough and I enjoyed the creamy part on top.We sat upstairs which was a bit crowded, but cozy.

Our meal was 11 courses with the option to add an additional course. There were 2 wine pairings to choose from, a regular and premium one. We opted to have one regular pairing and share as we're not much of wine drinkers.During the meal they started off every course with a brief explanation of the dish. If there was a wine pairing for the course the wine would come first with an explanation as well. In between courses our utensils were changed as well.All the courses were really good.

There's good hip music playing as well so the atmosphere is lively for those looking to have a good night.

It was a unique pairing of textures and flavors. Interesting. I could appreciate the creativity behind the recipe.Polpo alla Griglia - Grilled octopus, smoked potato, soleggiati tomatoes, seaweed butter. While the octopus was tender and the dish was visually appealing, I found the blended flavors to be odd-tasting.Carre di Agnello - 8pc lamb rack, we asked for medium-rare. Came out more on the rare side and the meat was a little chewy. It was also lacking in flavour, carried only by the infused olive oil - the lamb could've used a lot more seasoning and char.Lorighittas al Mare - Hand-braided pasta, wild squid, bay scallops, chili, garlic, anchovy. Flavour was good and pasta was al dente. Unfortunate that the portions were rather small for $38.Spaghettoni ai Ricci Di Mare - Spaghetti, BC sea urchin, soleggiati tomatoes, pangrattato. I was most looking forward to this dish and most disappointed by it. Only 1-2 pieces of uni atop an otherwise uninspiring base. Though orange in color, the sauce did not taste of uni and instead, was completely overwhelmed by cheesiness. I got sick of its single-tone flavour and heaviness by my last bite.Overall, did I appreciate the dining experience and culinary innovation? For the most part, yes.

When our server came to our table, he was very friendly and wonderful. Too bad he did not come by that often. He did mention that they were short staffed and that the kitchen was very busy. A few times the busboy would almost throw our cutlery down on the table when resetting for the next course. He was also not consistent in setting down the cutlery. Knives facing different directions for each person or spoons on different sides of the knife or fork. Normally I would not care that much but when I go to a fine dining restaurant, I expect to receive a fine dining experience.The main reason for coming here was to have exceptional Italian food. The food itself was mostly good but it wasn\\'t mind blowing in anyway and did not inspire us to to come back. Especially not for the prices this place was charging. Here\\'s what we had:* Frittura Mista Di Pesce- Buttermilk-battered and deep fried shrimp and calamari with tartare sauce - the oil was clean and everything was fresh. It\\'s deep fried calamari and shrimp, nothing overly complicated.* Polpo Alla Puttanesca - Grilled octopus served with cherry tomatoes from Pachino, black olives, anchovies and capers from Pantelleria - the octopus was grilled well and not over done. The tomatoes were nice and fresh. It was good but not the best I\\'ve had.* Carpaccio Di Filetto Di Manzo Con Tartufo Nero Di Norcia E Stracciatella Di Burrata - Tomatoes with fresh black truffle from Norcia and burrata Stracciatella cheese - one of the most disappointing dishes! The Burrata was served to us too cold and the creamy centre wasn\\'t creamy at all. Made me wonder if we even got Burrata or if we got Mozzarella. There is a difference!* Fettuccine Alla Bolognese Di Mamma Laura - \"Little Ribbon\" fettucine with Mamma\\'s famous fresh homemade meat sauce - simple dish of pasta noodles with meat sauce. It was quite bland. I think the kitchen forgot the salt.* La Carbonara - Artisanal Zaccagni spaghetti tossed with crispy pork cheek from Amatrice, eggs, Sarawak black pepper and Roman *DOP Pecorino cheese - the sauce on this dish was  well seasoned and quite delicious! However, the spaghetti was undercooked. It wasn\\'t al dente, it was undercooked. When we finally had a chance to tell the server, he explained how the pasta chef is \"Roman\" and how the Romans feel this is how pasta should be cooked. He even mentioned that he\\'s had many debates about this with the chef in the past. Basically we were served undercooked pasta on purpose. He suggested that next time we should let them know that we want our pasta al dente, the Italian way. Seriously? If you know this is what your kitchen is going to do, then you should inform your customers at the time of ordering.* Bistecca Alla Brace - Grilled Prime Canadian striploin with mushrooms au jus - nice huge juicy steak with a good amount of sides but nothing super special.* Costoletta Di Vitello - Grilled white provimi veal chop - tender and juicy; however, another dish served under season. Since our table was sharing everything, the kitchen cut the veal for us.* Cheesecake with fresh fruit compote, strawberry Tiramisu, Classic Italian Tiramisu, Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust - the highlight of the dinner! All the desserts were delicious and presented beautifully on one large plate. Our favourite was the Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust.All in all, the food was good but did not meet expectations. Since the kitchen was so slow and we were getting really hungry, we only told our server about the food experience we had after eating.There are so many other wonderful places you can go to great Italian food and a fine dining experience.

Their branzino was the best dish of the night as well as their clam pasta. The seafood is all cooked to perfection. The service was good, and the ambiance of the place was modern and clean.

Joso's is filled with art on all the walls which was fascinating to take a deep look at while waiting for dinner. The Glass of Grasevina was pleasant, fresh, and dry with a delicious aroma. One of my favorites! In terms of food, you can tell it was all prepared with utmost care and simple yet traditional flavors. The Calamari & Shrimp Kornati was light, crispy, and just the right amount of saltiness. I absolutely loved the Alla Siciliana. Paired with the Grilled Octopus, both were remarkable dishes.

It was a refreshing and flavorful start to the meal.For our main entrees, I ordered the Isshin Red Miso ramen which set the food mood as it had a wonderful aroma. The thick and wavy noodles were perfect as the ground tofu and wood ear mushrooms were able to intermingle with the noodle's waves nicely. The depth and dimensions were outstanding. My Hubby had the Vegetarian Roasted Garlic Shoyu which my Hubby declared was delicious, with two varieties of mushrooms: shiitake and button. Both our noodles had the perfect bounce and the soups were rich, we quaffed all of it.We concluded our meal with Kakigori Hochi Cha. Our shaved ice was very different from the Korean Bingsu we were accustomed to, as we found this to be more refreshing. The Japanese Kakigori is ice based and made from water. The ice had been grounded down to flakes and then the sweet milky Hochi cha was adorned on top of the ice flakes. Beyond sublime! It was a seasonal special so always ask what their seasonal desserts are and save room for them.My only suggestion is for the servers to take away the trays, as the tables are a bit tight.

The sake is delicious! We went on a Thursday and they had a $3 Sake Bomb special. We arent a fan of Sake bombs, but whenever a group would order, the entire restaurant would chant for them. A super fun environment!The food- I would rate it 100 stars if I could. We got a few things to start:- Wasabi Octopus- this is the most painful and most delicious thing I've ever tasted. The wasabi would kick you butt and then disappear in seconds. I felt it in my nose and my toes.- Baked Oyster - I hate mushrooms, but this was so well seasoned and the flavors worked so well. A mix of creamy, savory and delicious- Calamari - Cooked so well and hand breaded. The flavors were a little spicy but also creamy. The crunchy chips on the bottom also give a nice texture.Then came the main courses! My husband ordered udon that was more of a traditional broth udon dish with beef. The broth and beef were so flavorful! It was way more complex than some of the more simple udon-broth dishes you usually get. I ordered the Carbonara Udon. AH-MYZING! The egg was so lightly poached and mixed perfectly with the sauce. Simple in ingredients but perfectly crafted.We were visiting, but I could tell that this was a place that locals also come as well. It was pretty full when we got there, but they were able to seat us quickly. Get a reservation if you can. If you get a chance, this is a place to try!\",\n",

However, the food, despite some efforts at upscale English pub food, falls apart a bit on the execution.The fish and chips plate looked great, but was seriously under-seasoned, and the batter was falling away from the fish. The fries were likewise under-seasoned, and also cut thick and under-fried, creating more of a baked potato effect. The tartar sauce, homemade and in an individual ramekin, was ice cold and rock-hard, likely spooned out in advance of service and left in the fridge. I cut it with a knife!The interior is great, all dark wood and antique furniture. The crowd is on the mature side and they appear to do a brisk after work business.

       " 'Had an experience that definitely left a bad impression. I\\'ll explain towards the end since it happened at the end of the meal.The initial reservation process was easy, and we were able to get an early dinner table for New years Eve. There was a prefixe menu available for the night - no gratuity specified. Service was alright, felt a little rush/quick. They kept clearing things from the table right away and setting down courses before we were done with the last. I thought they were just being really attentive but thinking back, they just wanted turnover.The food was alright. The initial course you can choose cheese or deli meats. I find it a bit odd that they don\\'t offer a small mix of both. I literally received 3 pieces of cheese while my bf got a plate of salami and charcuterie meats.The appetizer was great. I had the carpaccio while my bf enjoyed their Bosco pear salad with beets. We ordered non alcoholic drinks as well which were super disappointing. I got pear nectar soda and he got peach. They tasted nothing like the fruits. It was essentially soda water, but I really just didn\\'t want to bother.  At $10 each, I would recommend you take a pass. Just order wineMy bf got the beef tenderloin which he thoroughly enjoyed and I ordered the branzino. I enjoyed the flavor but I was disappointed with the skin on the fish. It was super soggy which created a bad mouth feel. Otherwise the dish was good. I wouldn\\'t order it again though.Dessert was alright. I\\'m not a dessert person so my bf enjoyed it all. There was an orange Panna cotta, tiramisu slice, poached pear and cannoli. The cannoli was really soggy. I think they pre filled these a while before serving. Disappointing for a restaurant of this style and caliber.Now here is why I took this from a 4 star to a 2.  When paying our bill, the server didn\\'t give us our space to do the gratuity. He actually watched my bf type the percentage. It was generous but I guess he didn\\'t feel it was generous enough because he TOOK THE MACHINE FROM MY BOYFRIEND AND SAID \"here, I\\'ll do it for you\". He then entered a higher percentage and then told us it\\'s new years Eve. Now, I\\'m not here to start the to tipping culture conversation. But tips are optional and up to the guest to decide. At no point is it up to the server to take the machine and enter what they want. It was incredibly rude and my bf had no idea how to react to that. So the server takes the machine, enters his own gratuity, and has the audacity to tell us it\\'s standard for the night.You bet I talked to the host and FOH manager right after. I\\'ve worked hospitality for years. Gratuity can be set for group reservations or sometimes events, but it was not at all the case this night. The host and managers got the servers name from us and they apologized. The manager was very kind to gift us a certificate and welcomed us to return again another night. I hope they realize they need to keep a closer eye on what the heck their servers are doing upstairs. They seem to be running some sketchy show up there. That server reflects poorly on his team. I wouldn\\'t want that guy serving my guests.If you get a server and they ever dare to tell you how much to tip them, you say no. It\\'s not ok. They are never to take that machine from you to enter their own number. They don\\'t get to do that. It\\'s incredibly rude and unethical.We\\'re unsure if we\\'d want to return. Maybe we\\'ll sit at the bar next time and just munch down on some apps. Their appetizer menu is quite nice.',\n",

It was the one pasta dish our server suggested, 3 of us got it.The carbonara was so salty, cheesy and the pasta was so undercooked. We also suspect it to be cream base because it was so saucy, almost like soup. It was awful. We all had a few bites and left 3/4 of the plate untouched.We ordered the calamari and shrimp to start. It was fresh and pretty good. The bread was also not bad, nothing special.The service was average, our server seemed annoyed explaining the specials to us. Mid way telling us the specials, he asked if we are really interested in knowing the specials... He was quick at refilling our waters. That's probably because they don't offer tap water. So we were suckered into buying bottled water. We spent $40 on water alone, for four people.It's an expensive meal, which I'm honestly ok paying, if it's a good meal. This was not worth it at all, and I don't recommend.\",\n",

We had the fois gras terrine, special sweet corn soup, lobster, filet mignon, lamb, Ontario peaches dessert and obviously the coconut cream pie. Each dish was very flavourful and had a subtle richness that didn't overpower the taste. The seafood risotto that came with the lobster was to die for, and the whipped potatoes with the filet mignon were such a nice touch.However, the ratio of fois gras to brioche was way off and they charged $5 for another, which in my opinion is kind of stupid (considering the meal was $500). In addition, i wish there was more lobster. So yes, this place is quite pricey, it's good, but I think they could have been a *little* bit more generous with some of the portions.The coconut cream pie, as usual, was DELICIOUS.

My favourite bite was the smoked salmon with caviar. The tart crust was so crispy, the salmon was very fresh and the caviar was a great pop of flavour.1. Hokkaido Scallop - these were the best scallops I've had! Super fresh with a hint of sweetness. The zesty sauce was a great compliment.2. Wagyu & Oyster - one of my favourite bites of the night. The wagyu was so buttery. I usually don't enjoy raw oyster, but this was very fresh. The 2 purÃ©es were refreshing and light. Excellent balance to the buttery wagyu.3. Shima-aji - these sashimi slices were so fresh. The spot of yuzu really brought out the natural flavour of the fish.4. East Coast Lobster - thoroughly enjoyed this dish as well. The lobster was springy and sweet. The uni was very creamy with a light salty flavour. The egg based sauce added to the creaminess of the dish. This was a very filling and comforting dish.5. Koshihikari Rice - this dish resembled a risotto. Loved the mushrooms used. The rice itself was slightly on the saltier side.6. Swordfish - very unique chewy texture. Loved the flavour of the spicy peppers and sauce.7. Pecking duck - very tender and flavourful. The purÃ©e was an amazing complement to the meaty flavour of the duck. Be sure to eat them together!8. Provimi Veal Tenderloin - this tasted so much better than it looked. It was one of the most tender steaks I've had. The light salt brings out the natural flavour of the meat. Don't skip out on the eggplant purÃ©e! It was an excellent complement to the veal if you wanted a stronger smoky flavour. I should also shoutout the butter milk bread, so soft and buttery!9. Dessert 1 - love the chestnut praline topping. Inside the chocolate dome contained ice cream and meringue. A delightful dessert with many textures and flavours.10. Petit Fours - contained yuzu Madeline, chocolate tart. Chocolate rum Choux, and CanelÃ©. This was my first time having CanelÃ© and I absolutely loved it!Overall one of the best dining experiences I've had! The waiter and all the staff were super attentive and friendly.

Roasted Suckling Pig-this dish contained crispy pork belly and a piece of pork shoulder served with a variety of veggies. Wow, this was the best pork that my SO and I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, tender, and seasoned. We almost licked the plate.2. Chicken Fried Oyster Mushroom-this dish came with perfectly battered mushrooms that tasted filling like protein. The perfect amount of Mayo and sesame seeds to finish.3. Penokean Hills Beef Tartare-this tartare was well seasoned and came with Bibb lettuce. There needed to be more lettuce but flavors were excellent.4. Duck Liver Pate-this dish was served with brioche which was a bit too thick and dry to accompany the pate. A lighter bread ursThe pate itself is flavorful and texture-ful but the strong strawberry scent masked the taste of the dish itself.5. Station Burger-voted Toronto's burger, this is a combination of sweet and savory with some sort of jam and Mayo with a perfectly cooked patty. Unfortunately, compared to everything else, this wasn't the best thing we've had. However, still solid!Service was excellent, and interior was nicely decorated.The meal itself comes with complimentary bread. The focaccia bread with cream and sunflower oil was also tasty. A little toasting of the bread and extra cream would have made it perfect.\",\n",

Our server was really nice and happily recommended some favorites off the menu.We opted for the Cavolo Nero Salad and the Mafalde Al Funghi.

       " \"While Osteria Giulia has been awarded a Michelin star, it's unlikely they'll receive a service award anytime soon. Having arrived five minutes early, they weren't ready to seat tables and we were asked to leave - no option to wait inside or at the bar, what a pain during a windy cold fall evening. Nonetheless, once we were seated, our waitress was warm and welcoming, making up for the poor first impression from the hostess.Luckily, the food didn't disappoint. The burrata e caviale ($45), although served a bit cold for my taste, was soft and fluffy, the centre creamy but doesn't ooze out upon being cut through. The simple starter was a cacophony of flavours mixing briny Italian caviar, sweet Asfodelo honey, and a smoky sourness from the Blackbird bread. That splash of sweetness from the honey was unexpected but absolutely made the dish.Pull apart the calamari ripieni con tonno ($36) before taking a bite and you'll find the delicate seafood stuffed with yellowfin tuna paste so there's a meatiness to each bite. It's topped with a puntarella and charred pepper salad, giving the calamari a refreshing crispy bite. I'm glad it wasn't overloaded with too many sauces so that the natural seafood flavours were present.In retrospect, the lorighittas al mare ($38) was too similar to the calamari. In fact, when the dish was presented, all I could see was a plate of squid rings, only to find many were circles of hand braided pasta. Our waitress explains what makes the dish special is the time intensive nature of creating the pasta, which did have a lovely bite to it. Everything is tossed in a tasty olive oil sauce with a hint of garlic, chilli, and an umami essence from anchovy. I just wish the dish had more of the bay scallops and even some spot prawns thrown in to make it taste more like a seafood pasta.I'm generally hesitant to order ravioli as it's usually a scant dish and when they are not adequately filled it can taste like you're eating pieces of dough. Osteria Giulia's ravioli doppi ($44) smartly has one side unsealed so they can be overstuffed with silky ricotta and sauce, so you get a gush of filling with each bite. Chunks of lobster and kernels of sweet corn add richness and texture to the dish. It was an impressive dish and the most memorable of the evening.This is a long review head to Gastro World for the rest.\",\n",

For party\\'s over 2, the chef will prepare 2 different meals (so in our case with 4 people, 2 people go the same thing), We all chose the 5 course menu... To begin, the servers ask if you have any dietary restrictions, or preferences. One person from our party chose to not include beef or pork in their courses, and instead opt for seafood. The first course is a seafood course, second is the \"foie gras,\" course which include fois gras and another type of meat. Third was the main course, our party received venison, ribeye, and halibut for the meat of our main, then comes cheese, and finally dessert.My first course was a hamachi dish (type of tuna) served with roasted carrots. This was served raw, but nevertheless it was delicious. The second course include foie gras, pork tenderloin, and a toasted crisp on top. The main course, my favorite course, consisted of the most flavorful, tender, venison, potatoes, artichokes, and a decadent sauce. Our cheese course consisted of a delicious goat cheese, crackers, and a raspberry jam. Our last course, dessert, as extraordinary... we were celebrating two birthdays that night, which our waitress knew after chatting with us, and due to that, the wonderful staff wrote \"happy birthday,\" on both of our plates!

Highly recommended if you're looking to try some of the best food in Toronto. Thumbs up.\",\n",

       " \"Walked by multiple times and decided to go for lunch, turned into one of the best meals I had in Toronto.  Started with tomato and mozzarrella, varied assortment of perfect heirloom tomatoes but with a unique dressing that elevated it above typical Caprese salad.  The main course was even better, had the fried chicken special, which was an Asian style chicken breast served that you wrapped in lettuce with a side sauce. It was so good I kept debating whether to use the also good sauce because I loved the flavour without it.  I also truly enjoyed the fried squash, which was indescribably good.  The sauce was almost a hollandaise and it included toasted pumpkin seeds that were incredible but did not taste like pumpkin seeds.  A truly great lunch and I'll be returning with friends (tomorrow).\",\n",

       " \"I'm not sure how to rate this. 4/5 stars pre-COVID because everything I ordered was amazing and the menu selection was huge. But I came once indoor dining was open and the menu was considerably condensed. The explanation was a lot of the items were not in season (like the baked oyster with cheese, almond tofu dessert). And a lot of my favourite items weren't there. I guess with COVID, ingredient prices have gone up but I feel like the whole reason I enjoyed kinka in the past was the wide variety of flavourful items. Anyways, today we ordered the ebimayo deep fried shrimp, takoyaki, takowasabi, karaage, salmon & scallop pressed sushi, special items menu.Things I'd order again:takowasabi - strong wasabi flavour and a classic nose punch burn. Very flavourful. Yummy).Aburi buta bara (grilled pork belly with garlic sauce) - nice smoky bbq taste. Good flavour.Tokyo fry (French fries with garlic mayo)- mc Donald's like French fries. Tasty.Nama grapefruit cocktail- you get to squeeze your own grapefruit. Picturesque. Tasty!Things that coasted in the middle:Salmon oshizushi (blow torched pressed salmon sushi)- salmon was tasty but the rice a little too mushy but held it's shape.Things I wouldn't order again:salmon nattoyukke (salmon sashimi/seaweed/onsen tamago)- the lightly cooked sunny side up egg mixed with the salmon sashimi seaweed salad just didn't suit my taste buds at all. I found it very unappealingly bland. My least favorite dish of the night.Kamo tataki (sous vide duck breast)- okay taste but dry.Hotate oshizushi (pressed scallop sushi)- blandKaraage - nothing special.Ebi mayo - all I could taste was fried batter doused in mayo. And I'm sad because I swear this used to be one of my favourites. Batter was quite thick.Takoyaki- good texture but the sauce was overly ketchup-y. Overpowered the overall taste.My server was nice and I enjoy whenever they greet you upon entry. I look forward to the day they bring back their usual menu that I loved so much. I'll update my review then.\",\n",

The first few courses were very tasty and unique - we really enjoyed the tom yum pudding, pomelo betel leaf, and crispy octopus taco. Also highly recommend the tom yum cocktail! The dumpling course was also great and enjoyable. The final course was where we were disappointed - included the fried trout and choy dish. The choy was great but the fried trout was difficult to eat. We didn't feel satisfied at the end of our meal and didn't find that it was worth the tasting menu price. However, we would come again to try different menu items as I feel like the last course was a miss. Service was good, and the environment is very nice! I would give this spot a 3.5/5.\",\n",

The layout of the restaurant is different than most as you walk into the place with an open kitchen and you can see everything going on. It was dim and cozy building the ambiance of a nice date night spot.As for the food, our table tried the arancini, calamari and mafalde ai funghi (aka mushroom truffle pasta). The arancini was delicious and reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory mac & cheese balls. The calamari I'd skip as it was mediocre and was nothing memorable. The star of the night (other than me) was the Mafalade ai Funghi. As a meat lover, I've never thought I'd rate a dish a 10/10 that had no proteins in it but man this dish changed my mind. It's definitely a must try and something you will crave and come back for.The service was pretty good but nothing to rave about, she was attentive and that's all we could've asked for.Only reason this place isn't a 5 star for me is the price.

Looks like a popular spot for bachelorette parties because we saw a few there.We ordered the oyster kakimayo, sashimi platter, carbonara udon, and curry cheese bibimbap.

My favorite piece was the ebi. The udon was great. It comes with a perfectly poached egg that you mix in with the noodles. Bibimbap was fine - nothing special. It probably could have used more cheese but I don't think it's something you couldn't make at home with those Japanese curry blocks.I wish they had a location in NYC.

It's perfect for special occasions with friends, partners, parents/kids, etc. It is quite intimate inside, it didn't get too loud which I appreciated.The dinner consisted of 17 courses, my partner and I ordered the sake pairing on top. There were 3 chefs preparing for ~15 people. Every course was carefully assembled and explained, getting to watch it made the meal that much more enjoyable. The sake pairings went well with every course as well, it tied everything together.If you plan to dine-in, reservations aren't mandatory but highly advised due to the popularity and size of the restaurant.TLDR: I highly recommend! I suggest reading other people's reviews too, we all agree with the amazing experience and quality of food. Please go and experience Yasu, you won't regret it!\",\n",

       " \"Service Complaint - Intimidation/Harassment/AbuseI have never posted a negative review, but my experience with Cactus Club Cafe was horrific, unprofessional, and abusive. I will never return to Cactus Club Cafe again or recommend it to anyone.I visited Cactus Club Cafe First Canadian Place Friday night after a full-day conference in the city. After the conference, an attendee, whom I had met at the conference that same day, and I decided to go to Cactus Club.We ordered separately, with each of us ordering one drink and one food item, and after we finished, we asked for separate bills. As we were waiting for our server to bring the machine, the guest whom I arrived with said that she was going to the washroom, but she had, in fact, dined and dashed.A gentleman who introduced himself as the manager then came up to me and explained the situation. I was surprised to hear what he said, and I explained to him that I was unaware that she was going to dine and dash, as I had just met her that day.I explained to him that I was more than happy to pay for my own bill, but I was not responsible for hers. He then asked if I had her phone number or contact information, and I replied no because I had only met her at the conference and I had no personal relationship with her. The manager then proceeded to call security and they managed to track her down, at which point she allegedly pretended like she did not speak English and left.By the way, both the server and the security guard could testify that she did speak English. The manager then returned to me and threatened me with intimidation tactics, saying that he would file a police report and accused me of colluding with her.I said I would be more than happy to contribute to the police report because I knew I was innocent in this situation and disagreed with her actions. I explained to him that I was a victim in this situation, and the person who committed a crime was her, not me, that he should not be taking out his anger on me, and that I was not to be blamed or held liable for the actions of another adult.I also advised him that Canadian law does not entitle him to judge that I am guilty in this situation. I emphasized that I had no part in her plan to dine and dash, and I reminded him that I was more than happy to pay for my own bill. He then brought over the machine, and I paid my bill.As soon as I had paid, he called for security to escort me out and told me that I was banned from this establishment. I have been to Cactus Club dozens of times over the last 5 years, and I have always been a respectful customer and come to enjoy reasonable service, yet I cannot believe the abuse that I had to endure for somebody else's actions that had nothing to do with me.The fact that the manager at Cactus Club threatened, harassed, humiliated, intimidated, abused, and penalized me over the actions of someone else while making false and unfounded accusations about my involvement, character, and moral integrity was extremely unacceptable and inconsistent with my rights as a Canadian and lawful customer.Suffice to say, I am extremely disappointed with how the manager at Cactus Club handled this situation. I was abused and threatened by your manager. I did what I was supposed to do in this situation: I paid my bill, and I cooperated with your staff. But for the manager to take out his anger on me rather than the individual who committed the crime is extremely abusive and predatory.Never again will I step foot inside Cactus Club. They should have called the police and tracked down the girl who dined and dashed rather than place the blame on me. I am a paying customer -- I'm not a scapegoat or piÃ±ata for the service staff to lash out on, intimidate, threaten, and abuse. I did not deserve to be treated me like a criminal when I did nothing wrong.To make matters worse, I reached out to the Guest Experience team at Cactus Club, and they have not responded at the time of this review.\",\n",

We started with the carrot and zucchini fritters, crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the middle. The beet salad was fresh, with green apple and a chÃ¨vre dressing...more apt for the summer months, like the Revel.The scallops were done just right. And they were nice and big. Finally, the fried chicken karage style were delectable with a sweet heat and juicy dark meat pieces perfectly battered and fried.We had the quince tart to close and it was a strong choice. Butter-forward but not heavy due to the light pastry and subtle flavour of stewed quince, not too sweet.Finally, what a beautiful space and great service! So cosy but also sophisticated.

Behind these taller than lifesize double doors, you descend down a flight of steps.Your eyes squint in the dimly lit entrance as you're asked about your reservations, valet, and coat check by a line of ladies.Once checked in, you're led through the 3 compartment labyrinth starting with the piano lounge (chill and for groups), up a stairs to another busy (family/groups) section including a bar (single seats), and then finally to the romantic (2 person or 4 persons table) section.Along the way to the romantic zone, you walk by this giant fridge full of these impressive cuts of meat. All I remember was that they were meaty and juicy, and humungous.Server then comes with menus and introduces the steak menu, and the fact that you can order half portions of the sides. We had a look at the menu beforehand so had a rough idea of narrowing down our choice of steak.The steak menu is vast with steaks ranging from $100 to just under a cool $1,000. But if you think that was impressive enough, you haven't looked at the wine menu. Hundreds and hundreds of different wines.We ordered a shareable steak, the Caesar salad (which is a fun little show where they make it infront of you), a few JUMBO shrimps (seriously, the biggest shrimps I've ever seen), and the mash potato and mushroom sides.The steak was succulent and perfectly cooked. The sides were a bit underwhelming and the cocktail I ordered wasn't that spectacular. Moving to desserts, we had the flourless chocolate cake with mint ice cream and loved it. Thought the mint ice cream was similar to Bang Bang on Ossington.Service was attentive, but we noticed that we didn't get the full explanation of how the meal was cooked like how the other tables did. They fold your napkins for you when you're in the washroom which is nice.They did light a candle on my dessert and wished me a happy birthday but no comp on the dessert, which is fine.Price: expect to pay $150+ per person but the sky is the limit.

Soft shell crabs had good meaty parts, and I liked them. The beef tataki was ok but the sauce was mysteriously sweet - I expected that tataki to come with sauce with a hint of sourness.I found the sashimi pieces were too thick, ignoring each fish\\'s unique delicacy. I did not like their presentation of sashimi with \"thicker the better\" thinking. I expected that each fish be cut at an appropriate thickness to maximize the unique character, and the hamachi could be better if it was thinner with more slices. But I should not expect such delicacy in this casual Izakaya-like place.I wanted the Asahi to be served chillier. It lost hoppiness and crispness when it was served. Their warm sake was not served at the appropriate temperature - under-warmed, and losing the alcohol punch.Overall, this place does a good job to recreate the Japanese Izakaya atmosphere, giving patrons a good personal space to enjoy chatting with friends.',\n",

They all were good in their own ways. One downfall to this place is that the bowls don't come with much. You literally have to add extra toppings that range from $1-$8.5 and you can see bowls will come out even more expensive. The menu has pictures but doesn't actually tell you what's in every bowl. Service was great which is pretty rare for an asian establishment! Our server was very sweet and took his time telling us what was included in each of the individual bowls.

       " 'I\\'ve been hearing raving recommendations for Bar Isabel and finally got a chance to try it out this past weekend. Reservations are highly recommended as it got busy VERY quickly during the course of our meal. Bar Isabel is a Spanish tapas style restaurant with renowned drinks.FOOD (4/5)As a group of 4 we ordered a decent list of items starting with Sourdough bread, slices of Coppo, Jamon Croqueta (croquettes). And the more substantial dishes consisted of the Bone Marrow, Picahna Steak, Patatas Bravas (homefries), and Seabream Ceviche.The sourdough bread was very standard, nothing to write home about. The slices of Coppo, which we were told were from the pig neck, was a nice cured meat but wasn\\'t too special imo. The croquettes were PHENOMENAL! By far my favourite single bite of the night. Super creamy, rich, and decadent coated in a crispy shell. Definitely recommend the croquettes.The bone marrow was a bit underwhelming in taste and plating. It\\'s served with charred bread, a chimichurri, and sea salt. It was good, but it didn\\'t wow.The patatas bravas was a plate of \"homefries\" garnished with spring onions and sauces. I thought they were quite tasty and the sauces reminded me a bit like Indian masala.The sea bream ceviche was really tasty, refreshing, light and added levity to the meal. We ordered the large size and it had enough filling to share for 4 however did not have enough chips to portion.The steak was well seasoned and cooked to a nice medium temp. It is served with caramelized onions that paired well with the cuts of steak.Overall, the food was good quality and some dishes were really tasty but did not really wow me (apart from the croquettes).DRINKS (2.5/5)Bar Isabel is ranked fairly highly in bars in Canada and Toronto so we had high expectations going in. We ordered the Rambla Highball, Barragana and the house Vermut. The rambla highball was nice and refreshing and a bit sweet. The Barragana was surprisingly offputting. They use a sage infused base that is SUPER strong and turns the drink very herbacious and the added jalapeno makes it simultaneously spicy. Amongst my group, we did not enjoy it. Lastly the vermut was pretty standard. Even after consulting with the waiter perhaps we ordered drinks not fit for our palette but it left much to be desired.AMBIENCE (3/5)The restaurant is overall quite dim with red lighting for effect to give a bit of a tavern feel. There is decor throughout to add to the tavern-esque look. I\\'d say it is a more unique ambience heightened when it gets busy and feels more lively. I must say though it is a bit impractical because often we found it was hard to read the menu or properly appreciate the looks of the food.SERVICE (5/5)Staff were very friendly and overall helpful with understanding the menu. They also came by multiple times to refill our water even though we could\\'ve done it ourselves. There is however a mandatory 20% gratuity fee for all dine in guests. I do appreciate that the payment machine did not prompt for additional tip which could\\'ve lead guests to accidentally tip twice.ACCESSIBILITY (5/5)Bar Isabel is directly on College Street in the West end and directly accessible by streetcar. There is also paid street parking on College as well as a parking lot for the neighbouring Metro that is also paid.PRICE (2.5/5)The prices is a bit on the higher end but you do get your money\\'s worth in terms of freshness and quality of ingredients.OVERALL (3/5)Bar Isabel provides good quality tapas style foods in a tavern-esque environment. Really recommend trying as a group, but be prepared to spend a decent amount to sample the different foods and be full. I wouldn\\'t mind returning but at this pricepoint I may feel more comfortable frequenting some other options in the downtown core.',\n",

They  were serving lunch menu with still a decent selection of curry,  pad gra pow, Pad thai and Khao soi.We ordered the curry of the day: Massaman curry $13.99. We also upgraded to combo $4.50 which comes with cup of Tom Yum soup and fresh roll. The curry has small Parisienne potatoes, peanuts, tamarind, and your choice of  chicken, pork, tofu veggie. Sub beef/pork $1.50 extra or shrimp/fish $2.50 extra.There's a hint of sweetness from the tamarind sauce, and you can sip the broth like a soup.  So satisfying... You get a decent serving of Jasmine riceThe Tom Yum soup was a delicious medley of cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and tofu. The fresh roll consisted of tofu carrots and lettuce wrapped in rice paper. Chili tamarind sauce to dip. The presentation looked beautiful on the narrow plate.Three flavours pad thai $17.99 you have a choice of heat level:  0- no spice 1 - mild 2 - medium 3 - spicy 6 - Thai spicy 8 - Extreme thai spicy 12 - Chef top spicy.  I got it mild because I know how spicy it can get. The pad thai was perfectly assembled with crushed peanuts on top. The glass noodles were cooked with a tangy tamarind sauce with a generous serving of chicken breast meat. The portion was huge for lunch portions. We had some takeout!Service was friendly, and the server came by to check on us regularly.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some critically acclaimed Thai food. A symphony of flavours! Well done!\",\n",

       " \"4.5/5In my ongoing pursuit of Toronto's best fish and chips, I've visited notable establishments like Fresco, Sea Witch, and Old Yorke. Unfortunately, most of them fell short of my expectations, except for Old Yorke. However, a new contender has emerged that might just surpass the reigning champion: Oxley.Upon entering Oxley, you'll be greeted by an ambiance that effortlessly combines the elegance of a British pub with a welcoming atmosphere. The expansive back patio invites patrons to relax and enjoy their meal in style. With a two-story layout, it creates a secluded garden-like space that feels like a hidden gem.Now, let's talk about the star of the show: the fish and chips. Oxley's choice of fish is the haddock.The delicate, golden batter encases the fish perfectly, providing a satisfying crunch. Unlike the heavy batter found at Sea Witch, each bite at Oxley strikes the right balance between fish and coating, ensuring a delightful texture and flavor combination.Accompanying the fish are a range of delightful flavors. A sprinkle of flaky salt enhances the natural taste of the fish, while a gentle squeeze of lemon adds a refreshing citrus kick. The tartar sauce, slightly thicker than usual, surprises with its light and tangy profile. And here's where Oxley takes an unexpected twist: their unique sauce, reminiscent of the iconic butter chicken, adds a captivating dimension to the dish. The fusion of vibrant tomatoes, warm spices, and succulent fish creates a harmonious and memorable flavor experience.Let's not forget about the fries, which offer a departure from the ordinary. These larger-cut delights boast a fluffy interior and a golden exterior, reminiscent of the chips found in authentic British establishments. Although they may lack the traditional crunch, their unique texture adds an interesting element to the overall enjoyment.While my search for Toronto's ultimate fish and chips continues, Oxley has undeniably made a lasting impression. If you're seeking a top-notch fish and chips experience in a welcoming setting, Oxley is an establishment that deserves your attention.\",\n",

It was originally priced at $105 and was bumped for $140 a couple of weeks prior to dining. The chef's tasting menu is framed as a testing menu for potential new dishes on the permanent menu moving forward.Service is included with all prices and merely tax is needed. Tipping is discouraged.Staff were talented, in uniform. Some also wore a mask and gloves.The dining room is tightly packed and is quite casual, despite being located right in the middle of downtown Toronto. Parking is available in paid garages nearby.Started off with the selection of canapes and it was extremely well presented. From a taste perspective, it was lacking in terms of flavor...The tomatoes course was also mediocre. The shrimp were tiny and the anchovies were extremely salty. The presentation was good.The soy marinated hen's egg was also another miss. The egg was extremely salty while the sides were well presented.For the mains, had a tasting portion of the halibut and it was world class. The halibut was perfectly grilled unskinned and deboned. The inside of the halibut was perfectly moist and juicy. The side of peas and foam were all spot on.The bread course was also excellent. The bread was soft, baked to perfection, topped with butter and served with a side of butter.The dry aged duck breast course was also decent. Perfectly grilled duck breast cooked to a perfect medium pink on the inside and served with a side of mushrooms which were grilled to perfection.The deconstructed strawberry shortcake was mediocre.

Located in a mansion built in 1867, it was home to Canada's illustrious Massey family in 1882 that included the famous Hollywood actor, Raymond Massey. The Keg eventually acquired the property in 1976 and refurbished it to its original elegance to be their prestigious flagship restaurant.The Keg Mansion, as it is known, serves top quality steaks, prime rib and seafood in a refined and relaxed atmosphere. There are several dining rooms on both the main floor and on the second floor with its own unique ambiance.  We were fortunate to dine at the Keg Mansion during their special Lobster Summer menu. I ordered their 10 oz prime rib with half live Atlantic lobster. No doubt, the Keg knows how to cook and serve high quality meats.  The prime rib was tender, perfectly seasoned and flavorful. The half live lobster was split perfectly in half, grilled, and served with melted butter.  It was an excellent surf and turf dinner.  But leave room to share their Billy Miner Pie for dessert.  It was a delightful mocha ice cream pie that gives your dinner that perfect finish.Service was very good.  We sat on the second floor that had its own bar, but our waiter, Ray, gets his exercise by going up and down the stairs to the kitchen for our food. He was attentive and made sure our needs were taken care of by the support staff.  Parking is in front and adjacent to the restaurant. After 6pm, there is no charge in the adjacent public lot.The Keg Mansion is an excellent and popular Toronto steakhouse.
